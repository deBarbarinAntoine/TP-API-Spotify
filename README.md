# TP-API-Spotify


## Introduction

This TP-API-Spotify project is an assignment done in our first semester studying development. It uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and show some fixed content in a golang server using ```net/http``` package.

## How to execute it

To run it on your pc, you need to download the **<kbd>repository</kbd>** as a **<kbd>.zip</kbd>** file clicking on **<kbd>Code</kbd>** and then on **<kbd>Download ZIP</kbd>**.

Unzip it and then go to ```TP-API-Spotify/site_web/exec``` and right click in it. Then, click on **<kbd>Open in the terminal</kbd>**.

In the terminal, write that line and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
```
go run ./main.go
```

Then, it should display that:
```
Server is running...
If the navigator didn't open on its own, just go to  http://localhost:8080/  on your browser.
If you want to end the server, type 'stop' here :
```
_Don't close the terminal, otherwise, the server will stop automatically._

When you open your browser at the right *url*, you can then access the website.

To stop the server, return to the terminal and type ```stop```, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

A lot of information should be displayed in the terminal, because the program is currently quite verbose. Just don't worry about it.
